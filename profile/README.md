We are a group of software developers, embedded system engineers and model railway enthusiasts,
working on the open [BiDiB protocol](http://bidib.org/index_e.html) for controlling a model railway.

Join us in the [OpenDCC forum](https://forum.opendcc.de) to request access to this organisation and get started on your own project!
